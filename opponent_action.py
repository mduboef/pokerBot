# The agentâ€™s action,
# denoted by a, is determined by the current round state. Each state of the game
# consists of four components:
# 1. The private cards visible to the player.
# 2. The community cards visible to both player and opponent.
# 3. The current bet placed by you and
# 4. The current bet placed by the opponent.
# 5. This one is not listed in the instruction but also should be considered: how much money the opponent have (sum to 20000)

# Simple implementation using Monte Carlo Sampling
# Argument: the opponent will determine its next move based on the 5 states and
# They may also make their action based on the history, which is basically taking our player's action into consideration
# To take this part into account we would be basically predicting how the opponent predicts our action, which is nested
# We can probably ignore the history for now.
